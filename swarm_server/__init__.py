"""Hermes Swarm Server — P2P Multi-Agent Framework with Real-Time Monitoring.

Usage:
    hermes-swarm up                 # after `pip install` (recommended)
    python -m swarm_server          # equivalent module entry point

Hermes is resolved automatically (pip `hermes-agent`, else HERMES_AGENT_PATH,
else ~/.hermes/hermes-agent). See config.ensure_hermes_importable.
